# 🚀 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Java Practice

### 📌 About the Project
This repository contains my implementation of the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) challenge**, originally created in collaboration with **Digital Innovation One**. The goal is to apply fundamental **OOP principles** in Java through a practical project.

### 📚 Key Concepts Covered
✔️ **Abstraction** – Focusing on essential aspects of a domain.  
✔️ **Encapsulation** – Protecting internal implementation details.  
✔️ **Inheritance** – Reusing and extending class behaviors.  
✔️ **Polymorphism** – Treating objects of different classes in a unified way.  

### 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Java 11**  
- **VS Code IDEA**  
- **Git & GitHub**  

### 📂 Project Structure
The project models a **Bootcamp system**, including:  
- **Bootcamp Class** – Defines the program structure.  
- **Course & Mentoring Classes** – Represent educational content.  
- **Dev Class** – Handles participant data and progress.  

### 🚀 How to Run the Project
